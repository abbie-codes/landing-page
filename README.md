## Landing Page

Created for Udacity as part of a Front End Development Nanodegree.

For this project I created responsive landing page for a study app using Javascript, HTML and CSS. This website is one page. The navigation bar highlights the
section displayed in the viewport and hides when scrolling. 

The section that is in the viewport becomes active, highlights and an animation is added. When a user scrolls down the page a button appears to allow the user 
to scroll to top. All sections are collapsible.
